# Progress Report - February 24-25, 2025

## Fixes and Improvements to the Learn Screen

### 1. Fixed "Keep Learning" Section Re-expansion Issue
- Identified and resolved the issue where the "Keep Learning" section would not re-expand after being closed
- Removed the condition in the `toggleLessons` function that was preventing re-expansion after the first playthrough
- Added a new `useEffect` hook in the `KeepLearningSection` component to properly synchronize expansion state with the parent component
- Enhanced logging for better debugging of expansion state changes

### 2. Improved Video Playback Logic
- Enhanced video clip boundary enforcement with strict checks and logging
- Implemented loop detection and prevention mechanisms to avoid getting stuck in playback loops
- Added delay between seek attempts to prevent rapid seeking that could cause issues
- Improved video reset during transitions to new lessons
- Fixed initialization of video playback to ensure it starts at the correct clip start time
- Resolved issues with the YouTube player by using the correct methods for `YoutubeIframeRef`

### 3. UI Enhancements
- Temporarily added and then removed a debug button in the "Keep Learning" header for development purposes
- Improved styling and positioning of UI elements to prevent overlap
- Enhanced the visibility of controls and captions

### 4. Progress Screen Improvements
- Switched the positions of the "Work On" and "Streak" squares in the grid layout
- Made the "Daily Goal" box clickable to navigate back to the `learn.tsx` tab
- Added a blurred "Back to videos" button above the small text in the "Daily Goal" box
- Enhanced the styling of the "Back to videos" button with improved text shadow, border properties, and background color

### 5. Code Structure and Performance Optimizations
- Reorganized code structure to fix linter errors related to variable declarations and function dependencies
- Memoized props and implemented custom equality functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Fixed dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks to ensure proper cleanup and prevent memory leaks
- Improved error handling throughout the application

### 6. Splash Screen Update
- Updated the splash screen image in `app.json` from `splash-icon.png` to `splash.png`

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Fixed linter errors throughout the codebase
- Improved code organization by ensuring variables and functions are declared before use
- Enhanced error handling and logging for better debugging
- Implemented proper cleanup in `useEffect` hooks

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring video playback for any remaining edge cases
- Consider further UI refinements based on user feedback
- Explore additional performance optimizations for smoother transitions between lessons
