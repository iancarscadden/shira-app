here is the revenue cat entitlement information: 

Entitlements
Manage Entitlements across all Apps

An Entitlement represents a level of access, features, or content that a Customer is "entitled" to. Many Projects only have one Entitlement, for example, "Pro access".

Now here is the information in the "offerings" for revenue cat dashboard:

Offerings
Manage Offerings across all Apps

Offerings are the selection of products that are "offered" to a Customer on your paywall. They're an optional, but recommended feature of RevenueCat that can make it easier to change and experiment with your paywalls.

Offerings can also be used to test different pricing combinations as variants in an Experiment. Learn more.

Continue to expplain. here is what we want to do. we want to initialize revenue cat in our shira_app folder as that is our expo project. we first want to look over the codeabse and understand how it is put togeather, we can list the file directories and investigate and find what we need to do so implement this. we also have a file called paywall.tsx that we can change to be the paywall that comes from revenue cat.
