New feature: When the user opens the app we curretnly have logic and methods to update to check the last active date and the current and the update the users daily streak accordingly. I want us to have a display the comes onto the screen to notify the user for a quick second if their daily streak goes up. Here is the flow. say the user opens the app, we have our inital logic to check and update the streak, when now when the user strak update logic is trigger to incremet it when the user gets into the app one the screen they will a shiny purple pink semi big sqaure in the middle of the screen that says daily streak! with the users daily streak number form the DB and then under that it will say much xp they need to get to the next level. now this will only be on the screen for about 1.5 seconds where it will then fade away, and not come up again until the next time the streak update logic is triggered. now and as an example if the user is opening the app and their streak is not being updated, this will not come up. I want us to implement this, and then on learn.tsx somewhere on the screen add a small button that will trigger this component to come up so we can test it to see what it looks like. rememeber this square will be overlaying everything on which ever screen it comes up on, it is like a modal that is coming up over the screen. we can put its file in the views directory in app/views
