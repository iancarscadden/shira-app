Update current feature in learn.tsx:

What we want to do is look at the keyphrase logic that we currently have for highlighting the "highlightPhrase"
that we read in form the data for the video, and our logic for where we take it and then when that exact phrase
comes up in the captions we highlight it and perform the loop logic that we curretnly have in place.

Here is what is happening right now: for some of the videos there is just no highlited phrase on the screen
as our current phrase highlighting logic must be not good (or maybe we need to strip it of periods in the highl
ighted phrase). We need to look at our logic for the hightlighting phrase and perform some analysis of why for
for videos it could not be hightlighting, and then propose some fixes / solutions to this logic in our code.
