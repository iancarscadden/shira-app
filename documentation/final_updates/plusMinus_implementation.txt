New feature: -2 and +2 buttons in learn.tsx.

In learn.tsx we curretly have in the video controls section with the translate button a -2s and +2s buttons that 
curretly dont do anything. Want we want to do is take these buttons and make it so that when the -2s button 
is pressed it goes back 2 seconds in video, and when the plus 2 seconds button is pressed it goes forward 2 
seconds on the video.

Now we also need to follow specifics for these buttons, we want to remain in the clip boundries, so if the minus
2 seconds button is pressed and we want to check if going back 2 secods would go back farther over the left boundery
of the clip, and if it would we just go back to the starting of clip even if its less than 2 seconds, then lets
think about the plus 2 seconds button, we want to make it so that if the plus 2 seconds button is pressed and it 
would cause the video to go over the right clip boudry so the clip the end, we want to make it so that it just gets
the time but to the beginning of the video

Now we want to think about the obvisoues if the buttons are pressed and they wont interphere with any boundires,
if the minus 2 seconds is pressed, we just back 2 seconds, if the forward 2 seconds is pressed we jump forward 2 seconds
