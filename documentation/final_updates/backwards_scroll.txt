New feature:

We are now going to imeplement backwards scrolling in the learn.tsx. Right now the only way the user can scroll
is by scrolling up to go to the next video, we are then reseting all of the states and as as refreshing all of 
the data in learn.tsx pertaining to the video to now have the data of the video we are curretly on, as
to not cause any bugs we want to keep it so that the only data that is in the app at a time relating to a peice
of content is only that data for the peice of content. 

How it is right now. Right now the user can swipe up to then activate actoins that take the users current_lesson_id
incrment it by 1, pull in the data for the video at content id of the current_lesson_id + 1, and then set the users
current_lesson_id in the database to be that n+1 value. 

What we want to implement: we want to imeplemt a way now for the user to swipe down on the screen where in doing so
we pull the current_lesson_id that they are on (call it n) we then go to n - 1 and we pull what is at n -1 in the content
table, we then take n -1 and make that the new current_lesson_id for the user in the database. 

What we need to add: we will need to add a file just like the NextVideoIndicator file for the now going backwards
a video, with the sliding white gradient that slides all the way through the screen when the loading is completed. 
This time it will be directed down though as we are in a sense just reversing the swipe up and all its effetcts.

Now in thinking about the our new feature of going to the previous video, it in a sense is really just like the 
same code and logic as going to the next video, just we are going backwards with the video id, so we need to make
sure our code is nice and sound to handle this as well as updating in the database. We really want to make sure that
we are alwasy refreshing all states and all data when a new video is read in.
