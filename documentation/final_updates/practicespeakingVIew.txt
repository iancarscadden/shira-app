New screen and feature:

We are now going to desin the new area in the app where the user will be able to see their discovered phrases.

For now we are now going to connect this with any database services or any backend logic, we are just going to
build the UI. 

In progress.tsx we have a section for have a conversatoin, where the user can press it, and we now need to build
the screen that pressing on that sectinon takes the user to.

this section will be called discoveredPhrases.tsx and will be put in the /views directory. Now this screen
will need to be designed to look very similar to the style of the practice speaking element in progress.tsx
as well as the similar styles in progress.tsx 

Right now this screen will just have a dummy list of some spanish phrases as we want to get down the UI before 
moving on to adding any real database functionality. this screen will also need a way from it to get back to
progress.tsx main screen. also, we dont need to make the phrases pressable at the moment they just need to be in a 
nice looking list where they look like things you can press.
