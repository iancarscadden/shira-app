NEW FEATURE: 

We are now going to be revamping the onboarding process for the app. All of the onboarding screens we use for my app are contained in /app/onboarding, with also the app/login.tsx also technically being an onboarding screen. Step1 in the inital screen, where the user can continue on to create an account, or they can also hit login to go straight to log in if they are already a user. now in the next steps of onboarding we ask the user questions, like what language they want to learn, as well as other questions that are just for show and dont have any database implications. we want to edit onboarding step 5 to now be about daily goal for videos, and we want it to be 5, 10, or 15 video for the choices here and we also want to edit the final account creation function that is already in place to add a field for daily_goal that will write the new users daily goal to the database. 

Now the name of the game here is want to revamp, the onboarding and make it look great and also allign with the rest and colors of the app that we have been working with so far. Ensure that the new things you make and implement work with the flow of the screens and my inplace database functions.
